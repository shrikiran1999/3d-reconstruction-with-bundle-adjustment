    "1. Students are encouraged to work in groups but each student must submit their own work. Include the names of your collaborators in your write up. Code should <span style='color:red'>Not</span>  be shared or copied. Please properly give credits to others by <span style='color:red'>LISTING EVERY COLLABORATOR</span> in the writeup including any code segments that you discussed,  Please <span style='color:red'>DO NOT</span>  use external code unless permitted. Plagiarism is prohibited and may lead to failure of this course.\n",

    "5. **Attempt to verify your implementation as you proceed:** If you donâ€™t verify that your implementation is correct on toy examples, you will risk having a huge issue when you put everything together. We provide some simple checks in the notebook cells, but make sure you verify them on more complicated samples before moving forward. \n",

If you need to import other functions, please remember to comment them out after submission. Our autograder will crash if you import a new function that the gradescope server does not expect. \n",
